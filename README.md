## Introduction

Heart Failure Prediction is a machine learning project developed to predict the probability of heart failure based on clinical data. It uses a dataset containing various health metrics such as age, anaemia status, creatinine levels, and more.

## Features

- Trains a machine learning model to predict the probability of heart failure.
- Provides insights into which clinical features contribute most to the prediction.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics.

## Installation

To get started with Heart Failure Prediction, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adaambiikgabz/Heat-Failure.git
    cd Heat-Failure
    ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
